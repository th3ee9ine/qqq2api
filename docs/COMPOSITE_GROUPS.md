# Composite Groups

Composite groups are an admin routing layer for API keys that should choose a
concrete provider from the requested model instead of binding the key to a
single provider group. They support both built-in model detection and an
admin-configured model route registry for public model aliases.

## Supported Providers

Composite groups can route to these concrete account platforms:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI

The selected concrete platform is used for account selection, post-usage
billing, ops error platform attribution, model mapping/pricing lookup, and
platform usage reporting.

## Route Registry

Admins can configure routes on a composite group from the group list's
`Routes` action or through the admin API:

- `GET /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes`
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/:route_id`
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/:route_id`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/groups/:id/composite-routes/preview`

Each route belongs to one composite group and contains:

- `public_model`: model identifier the client sends.
- `match_type`: `exact` or `prefix`.
- `target_platform`: concrete provider platform.
- `upstream_model`: model identifier sent upstream. If omitted, the public
  model is reused.
- `endpoint`: `any`, `messages`, `count_tokens`, `responses`,
  `chat_completions`, `embeddings`, or `images`.
- `priority`: lower values win after match specificity.
- `enabled`: disabled routes are ignored by runtime resolution but remain
  visible to admins.

Resolution order is explicit route first, then built-in detection. When more
than one explicit route matches, exact matches beat prefix matches,
endpoint-specific routes beat `any`, longer prefixes beat shorter prefixes,
then lower `priority`, then lower route id.

For JSON-body endpoints, the gateway rewrites the request `model` field to the
route's `upstream_model` before dispatch.

Codex Alpha Search and Live requests use the `responses` route domain. Live
requests resolve the model from `session.model`, including multipart `session`
payloads, and apply the configured `upstream_model` before dispatch.
Codex model manifest requests reuse the existing OpenAI account selection and
failover path within the Composite group.

## Built-In Detection

Composite routing detects common public model IDs and provider-prefixed IDs:

- `claude-*` and `anthropic/claude-*` route to Anthropic.
- `gpt-*`, `o*`, `codex-*`, `text-embedding-*`, `dall-e-*`, and
  `openai/*` route to OpenAI.

Unknown or ambiguous model names fail closed with a client error instead of
guessing a provider.

## Admin Workflows

- Admins can create a group with platform `composite`.
- Admins can add, edit, delete, and preview composite model routes.
- Composite groups can copy accounts from concrete provider groups.
- Concrete provider accounts can be assigned directly to composite groups from
  account create/edit and bulk account workflows.

## OpenAI + Claude Setup

Use one composite group when one API key should expose model aliases across
OpenAI and Claude without issuing separate keys per provider.

1. Create concrete provider groups for the upstream account pools, for example
   `OpenAI Paid` and `Claude Paid`.
2. Create a `composite` group.
3. Assign provider accounts directly to the composite group, or copy accounts
   from the concrete provider groups during group creation.
4. Add explicit routes for public aliases that should not rely on built-in
   model detection:

   | Public model | Endpoint | Target platform | Upstream model |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `all/gpt-5` | `responses` | `openai` | `gpt-5` |
   | `all/claude-sonnet` | `messages` | `anthropic` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |

5. Configure model pricing and mapping for the concrete platforms named in
   each route. Composite routing does not create pricing records.

The same composite group can also rely on built-in detection for standard model
names such as `gpt-*` and `claude-*`. Explicit routes are
recommended for bundled plan aliases because they make endpoint, provider, and
upstream model attribution reviewable in the admin UI.

## Limits

Composite routes choose a concrete provider and upstream model; they do not
create synthetic model metadata, pricing, or upstream capability records by
themselves. Keep pricing/model mapping configured for the concrete provider
platforms that the routes target.

This PR intentionally does not implement:

- AUTO smart-routing among multiple providers for the same abstract task.
- Direct API-key binding to several existing groups without a composite group.
- Protocol-agnostic provider decoupling or a LiteLLM-style adapter rewrite.
